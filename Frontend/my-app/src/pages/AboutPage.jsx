            SHRÉEJI is a contemporary clothing brand dedicated exclusively to
            men and boys. Our purpose is simple — to create clothing that feels
            comfortable, looks refined, and lasts beyond trends. Every piece
            we offer is designed with real people, real routines, and real
            comfort in mind.

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed max-w-4xl mb-6">
              SHRÉEJI was born from a simple observation — while fashion options
              were abundant, truly reliable, comfortable, and thoughtfully
              designed clothing for men and boys was surprisingly limited.
              Most brands focused either on fast trends or high prices, leaving
              a gap for everyday wear that balances quality, comfort, and
              affordability.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed max-w-4xl">
              We set out to build a brand that understands daily life — school,
              work, movement, growth, and change. Our collections are designed
              to adapt seamlessly to everyday use while maintaining a clean,
              modern aesthetic.

                details define every product we create.
